            <p>Today, Tesla, Google, Uber, and GM are all trying to create their own self-driving cars that can run on real-world roads. 
                Many analysts predict that within the next 5 years, we will start to have fully autonomous cars running in our cities, and within 30 years, nearly ALL cars will be fully autonomous. 
                By using Cool cab we will be able detect and follow lanes, recognize and respond to traffic signs and people on the road in under a week.</p>
            <img src="img/CoolCab Prototype.png" alt="prototype of cool cab" class="portfolio-item-img">    
            <p>Cool cab is a Autonomous e-vechile which uses machine learning to drive the e-car.
                It is used to decreases the man power that we are using in our day to day life.
                By using our car we can reduce the wages for fuel and for the drivers.
                We had used python and OpenCV to teach our car to navigate autonomously on a winding single lane road by detecting lane lines and steer accordingly.
                We had used deep learning techniques such as single shot multi-box object detection and transfer learning to teach our CoolCab to detect various traffic signs and pedestrians on the road. 
                And then we had teached it to stop at red lights and stop signs, go on green lights, stop to wait for a pedestrian to cross, and change its speed limit according to the posted speed signs.
