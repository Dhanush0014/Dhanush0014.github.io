            <p>Advertisement is a technique used by product and service companies that detail the specific selling points of their products by means of which it becomes known to the masses. The main social cause of ad blocking system is protecting the user’s privacy. 
                Marketers usually place ads at calculated locations for their products such that they are able to draw the attention of potential consumers and persuade them to buy it. Online advertising or online marketing is a technique of delivering promotional messages to various consumers. 
                Hence it is more or less like forcing the consumer and annoying them with the continue reminder of their product. In spite of lot of interruptions and diversions that happens in people life are increasing, these advertisement becomes an addon. 
                This has led to a stark increase in security and personal concerns and issues. Users argue that they do not want such annoying advertisements on websites because it hampers their area of viewing actual content seamlessly and without obstructions.
                Some users also say that they could be used to deploy malwares and scams on the web.

            <p>Hence our adblocker system manages these problems.   by using ad blocking methodology in a hardware (Access Point) so that it works as universal ad blocker which consume resources and there is no need for managing different software’s on different devices. 
                The automatic updation of blocklists bring almost zero advertisements on the user’s devices and keeps the concentration in one place where they wanted and will not lead to vulnerability blockers hence it also improves users’ web-browsing experience, maintaining privacy, and recently protecting themselves against malware.</p>
